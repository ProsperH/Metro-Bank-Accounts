# Insights
### KPIs
$145M in Total Deposits.

800 accounts.

57 Approved Loans.

Average Credit Score: 579.5 → This is below the “prime” threshold (typically 650+). Suggests risk in the portfolio.

### Distribution of Account Types

Savings dominates (303 accounts), followed by Checking (246), Credit Cards (169), and only 82 Loans.
Customers are using Metro Bank more as a savings institution than a lending partner. 

### Average Balance by Customer Segment

Private: $275K

Retail: $267K

Corporate: $259K

Private customers hold the highest balances, but differences are marginal across segments. Even Retail customers are relatively wealthy.

Metro Bank serves a high-income client base overall, so upselling wealth products makes sense.

### Average Balance by Job Category

Top holders: Engineers ($280K), Traders ($276K), Teachers ($267K).

Lower (but still strong): Bankers ($249K), Students ($257K), Doctors ($263K), Retired ($263K).

Unexpectedly, Engineers and Traders are bigger balance holders than Doctors/Bankers. This suggests targeting STEM professionals and traders with premium offerings.

### Average Balance by Age Group

Millennials lead ($282K), then Gen Z ($268K), Boomers ($265K), Gen X ($248K).

Younger customers (Millennials, Gen Z) already hold high balances, unlike the traditional assumption that older = richer. This is promising for future growth. Wealth is shifting younger.

### Avg Credit Score (Approved vs. Rejected Loans)

Rejected loans = higher average score (591.8) than Approved loans (580.5).
This is counterintuitive. Normally, higher credit scores = more approvals. 

Here it suggests that Metro Bank’s loan approval criteria may not be aligned with credit score reality.

Other factors (like income, existing debt, or internal policy) weigh heavier than score.

The risk here is that the bank may be approving lower-quality loans while rejecting safer ones.

# Recommendations

1. Boost Loan Penetration

 - Launch targeted loan campaigns (personal loans, mortgages, SME credit lines).
 - Cross-sell loans to high-balance customers who are currently “deposit-heavy.”

2. Wealth Products for Young Professionals

   - Build investment & savings tools for Millennials and Gen Z (mutual funds, ETFs, real estate savings).
   - Market premium credit cards & perks to Engineers, Traders, and Teachers.

3. Review Credit Policy

  - Investigate why higher-score customers are being rejected.
  - Adjust risk models → approve more safe borrowers, reduce exposure to risky loans.

4. Customer Segmentation Strategy

  - Private clients: Exclusive perks (wealth management, concierge banking).
  - Retail clients: Affordable credit + digital financial tools.
  - Corporate clients: SME packages (payroll, business loans, expense dashboards).

5. Balance Growth Play

  - Since deposits are strong, bank can invest in lending expansion (mortgages, auto loans, SME loans). This will increase revenue and diversify risk.
